Before selecting or changing any task, run `bash external/ai-session-kit/scripts/check-planning.sh`. Stop on failure and request `/tasks` and explicit approval; never edit `docs/planning/` or select Superseded work. Implement the next eligible task from [docs/tasks.md](../../docs/tasks.md), following the project workflow in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). Work on exactly one task: mark it In Progress before starting, write a failing test, implement and test the change, and update its task status when complete. If the task is genuinely blocked, immediately mark its row `⛔ Blocked · <reason>` in `docs/tasks.md` and explain the blocker. Do not write a session handoff; run `/handoff` separately when ending the session.
